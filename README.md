# To-Do List Web App (CRUD Operations)

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **React** (Frontend) and **Node.js/Express** (Backend) with a **MongoDB** database. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and view tasks.

## Features

- Create a new task
- Edit an existing task
- Delete a task
- View the list of tasks

## Folder Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:
1. **Frontend** - The React application responsible for rendering the UI.
2. **Backend** - The Node.js and Express API for handling task data and CRUD operations.
